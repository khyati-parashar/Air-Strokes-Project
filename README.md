# Air-Strokes-Project

## Abstract 
In the Air Strokes Project, we track the contours in order to display the mask created by the user using any object. This project is very helpful for creating your visual and representing it on the screen of your client or meeting members(as its a great idea to incorporate such a feature in meeting aaps). This can be used by teachers for effective online teaching, as at times a teacher has no direct access to any black/whiteboard for explaining things. 
This can come in handy in such situations. 
As drawing in the air gives you more control over the movements as compared to using a mouse/mousepad for drawing/writing.

## Objective of the project 

1. The first goal was to detect the contours/object of interest of the user. 

2. Our second goal was to keep tracking the moment of the contours on the screen. 

3. Our third goal was to give some properties to the tracked object such as colour width, thickness and more. 

4. Our fourth goal was to display that on the screen of users.

5. The fifth goal was to provide the user to change the colour of the text. 

## Project Implementation 

This project is divided into two parts: Tracking the object of interest /contours, and represent that tracking on the screen of multiple users Tracking the object/contours. 
Contours can be explained simply as a curve joining all the continuous points (along the boundary), having the same colour or intensity. The contours are a useful tool for shape analysis and object detection and recognition. In OpenCV, finding contours is like finding a white object from a black background. 

We use the OpenCV method in order to track the object. Then using the line method we create the drawing on the screen. 

We also provided the colour option to the user (such that it doesnâ€™t dissolve the colour of the drawing with the surrounding) 
Represent the tracking of the object on the screen 
Video tracking is the process of locating a moving object (or multiple objects) over time using a camera. It has a variety of uses, some of which are: 
human-computer interaction, security and surveillance, video communication, augmented reality, traffic control, medical imaging and video editing. 
After that, we represent that tracking with colour and make another user see what the user writes in the air.
